    <p>New York City mayoral hopeful Zohran Kwame Mamdani, a socialist New York State Assembly member from Queens, drove a lot of social media traffic to his campaign last week.</p>

    <p>How? With a <a href="https://x.com/ZohranKMamdani/status/1857410216733651146" target="_blank">widely-shared video</a> in which he stands with a microphone on Hillside Avenue in Queens and Fordham Road in the Bronx to ask New Yorkers why they voted for Donald Trump.</p>

  <center><blockquote class="twitter-tweet" tw-align-center><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Why did so many working class New Yorkers vote for Donald Trump last week — and even more not vote at all? <br><br>I went to Hillside Ave in Queens and Fordham Rd in the Bronx to find out. <a href="https://t.co/1dXmnP01A4">pic.twitter.com/1dXmnP01A4</a></p>&mdash; Zohran Kwame Mamdani (@ZohranKMamdani) <a href="https://twitter.com/ZohranKMamdani/status/1857410216733651146?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 15, 2024</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></center>

    <p>Democratic nominee Kamala Harris still won New York, with approximately 55% of the vote, but did so with a smaller margin of victory than President Joe Biden in 2020, who took home around 60% of the vote. Meanwhile, President Elect Donald Trump picked up voters in nearly every county in New York. Harris won New York with a margin of victory roughly 11% narrower than Biden’s in 2020.</p>

    <p>Now, Democrats across the reliably blue state are scrambling to understand what went wrong.</p>

    <p>Of all New York counties, Trump made the greatest inroads in the Bronx and Queens. In the Bronx, he took home around 27% of the total vote — an 11% increase from the 16% of the vote he won in 2020. In Queens, the borough he once called home, Trump jumped from 27% of the vote in 2020 to 37%</p>

    <p>According to Shawn Donahue, a political science professor at SUNY’s University at Buffalo, Trump gains were concentrated in certain areas of the state.</p>

    <p>“When you start looking at where the change was, you see some of the bigger swings in Long Island, New York City and in the Hudson Valley,” Donahue, who specializes in New York State politics, said. “You didn't really see the big swing upstate.”</p>

    <p>Donahue noted that Trump’s New York gains were more prominent in areas with large Latino and Asian Pacific American populations.</p>

    <p>“There does seem like there's a movement among non-white voters in the past two elections to Trump,” he said. “Latino and Asian-American voters, I think that we were trying to lump them in, say that they're overwhelmingly Democratic. I think that they were a little bit more of a swing constituency than we might have realized.”</p>

    <p>Trump’s gains are also an indication that voters were dissatisfied with the economy under the Biden administration, Donahue said.</p>

    <p>“When the public isn't satisfied with the economy, you know that there's a swing against the party in power,” he said. “And that's clearly something that happened.”</p>
