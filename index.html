    <p>New York City mayoral hopeful Zohran Kwame Mamdani, a socialist New York State Assembly member from Queens, drove a lot of social media traffic to his campaign last week.</p>

    <p>How? With a widely-shared video in which he stands with a microphone on Hillside Avenue in Queens and Fordham Road in the Bronx to ask New Yorkers why they voted for Donald Trump.</p>

    <p>Mamdani is not alone. Democratic nominee Kamala Harris still won New York, but with a significantly smaller margin than President Joe Biden did in 2020. Her opponent, President Elect Donald Trump, picked up voters in nearly every county in New York.</p>

    <p>Now, Democrats across the reliably blue state are scrambling to understand what went wrong.</p>

    <p>Of all New York counties, Trump made the greatest inroads in the Bronx and Queens. He gained 11.02% percent of the Bronx vote compared to 2020, and 10.2% of the Queens vote.</p>

    <p>Harris won New York with approximately 55% of the vote, compared to Trump’s 37%. That margin of victory is roughly 12% narrower than Biden’s in 2020</p>

    <p>A citywide <a href="https://www.electionatlas.nyc/maps.html">data analysis</a> of 2024 election results by the CUNY Graduate Center’s Center for Urban Research shows that Trump gained the most votes in working-class neighborhoods like North Corona in Queens.</p>

    <p>“It shows an almost citywide shift to one degree or another towards Trump,” John Mollenkopf, who directs the Center for Urban Research, told <a href="https://ny1.com/nyc/all-boroughs/politics/2024/11/06/donald-trump-kamala-harris-results-nyc">Spectrum News NY1</a> about the data analysis.</p>

    <p>“That shift was most pronounced in some of the Asian and Latino immigrant neighborhoods, particularly Dominicans in Washington Heights and the western Bronx, and also in the various Chinese and Indian neighborhoods in Queens in particular,” he said.</p>
